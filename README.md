Spotify Whos-Who Guessing Game
===============================
# Overview

Developed a front-end React application that interfaces with [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/) in order to get genre's, artists, and **sample** songs. The user will then be able to listen to songs and guess which artist created it.

## Requirements

##### The *Business Requirements* are located in the [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) file.

The specification for this assessment is written in a way that resembles the kind of informal requirements document you may recieve on a client site or the level of detail you may have after a few meetings with stakeholders/product owners. It is written from a non-technical viewpoint with no regards for the technical requirements that the project may incur. 

When given large problems like this, it is easy to try to start coding immediately. This may not be the best approach to solving large problems - it can often make you waste a lot of time because you'll start solving problems before you really know what problems you need to solve. In order to get a sense for what is required technically, it is recommended that you first go through the ***Business Requirements*** thoroughly and try to envision the end goal from a business point of view. After that, go through it again from a technical perspective and begin mapping out mentally and physically (on paper if you'd like) the things you'll need to use and understand. For this project, these things may include: Missing requirements that you need to clarify, Spotify endpoints, A skeleton/wireframe of your components, routes, required business logic for selecting random artists within a genre, how to play a song in the browser, and so on. Note that these things don't require you to start coding - they require you to **research** and **read documentation**.
